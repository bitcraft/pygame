So what does Microsoft's Windows Installer have to do with Pygame.
Well, Pygame is destributed on Windows in a .msi file. And the
msidb.py module was originally written to help create a Windows
installer for the Pygame documents and examples. It is just too
useful to not have a home somewhere.

msidb.py is a Database 2.0 module for reading and changing Windows
Installer, .msi, files. It is moduled somewhat on the SQLite module
that is part of the Python standard library. It has enought features
to be useful but needs a proper until test and to be polished up
a little.

For now I will place it under the LGPL (copied from Pygame).
