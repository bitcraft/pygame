msidb.py is a Python Database API 2.0 module for reading and altering
Windows Installer, .msi, files. It is modeled somewhat on the SQLite
module that is part of the Python standard library.

So what does Microsoft's Windows Installer have to do with Pygame.
Well, Pygame is distributed on Windows in a .msi file. And the
msidb.py module was originally written to help create a Windows
installer for the Pygame documents and examples. The msilib package
bundled with Python 2.5 cannot read .msi files. This module can.
It is just too useful to not have a home somewhere.

For now I will place it under the LGPL (copied from Pygame).
