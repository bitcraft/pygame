A preliminary module import tracker.

This package tracks module imports and can generate a report on program
completion. It has been added to Pygame's SVN with the purpose of
incorporating it into the unit tests. The package still needs testing.
The package has been successfully tried on a zipped package. Still
should have a way to limit what modules will be tracked.


See the playmus.py example for how it is currently used.

rev 1740: - Report generation now optional.
          - Added a report end feature.

rev 1741: - Added a data inspection api.
          - Now have a data collection stop function.
          - For testing, reload resets the entire package.
          - Readied for capture of all module attribute accesses.
