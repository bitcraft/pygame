A preliminary module tracker.

This package tracks module imports and generates a report on program
completion. It has been added to Pygame's SVN with the purpose of
incorporating it into the unit tests. To that end it need testing
and report feature replaced some kind of runtime inspection mechanism.
Possibly the report generation can be optional. The data collection
sets in reporter can also be exposed with an api. Finally, should
it be a single module?

See the playmus.py example for how it is currently used.
